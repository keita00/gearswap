# Corsair (COR) Gear Progression Roadmap – Retail FFXI (2025 Updates)

## 🎯 Early Stage (Item Level ~119 baseline)  
### Objectives  
- Unlock COR if needed; gear up from scratch.  
- Acquire reliable TP / Ranged set + job ability/roll‑gear.  
- Use low cost tokens & content (Ambuscade, Omen) to establish foundation.

### Gear Goals  
- **Weapon (Ranged)**: Aim for a solid “token gun” (e.g., Anarchy +2 via Hallmarks) before going Mythic/Empyrean.  
- **Armor (Token / Entry)**:  
  - Meghanada +2 set (good ranged attack / accuracy boost)  
  - Malignance set or similar for survivability  
- **Accessories**:  
  - Head: Lanun Tricorne +3 (AF)  
  - Neck: Iskur Gorget (or similar)  
  - Ears/Rings: Telos Earring, Crep/Crep+ variants, Ilabrat Ring, Regal Ring  
  - Back: Camulus’s Mantle (basic version)  
  - Waist: Kentarch Belt +1 or equivalent  

### Content to Run  
- Ambuscade (normal/hard) → tokens/hallmarks  
- Omen cards (for starters)  
- Use “foundation” content to build currency and tokens before high‑end raids.

## 🧩 Mid Stage (Relic / AF +3 / iL119 upgrades)  
### Objectives  
- Begin investment into true COR sets: AF (Lanun), Relic (Commodore), and eventually Empyrean (Chasseur) if you want endgame.  
- Upgrade your weapons and accessories accordingly.  
- Adjust sets to include ranged attack, snapshot, store TP, WS support.

### Gear Goals  
- **AF (Lanun series)** – job ability/roll set:  
  - Lanun Tricorne +3  
  - Lanun Frac +3  
  - Lanun Culottes +3  
  - Lanun Bottes +3  
- **Relic (Commodore series)** – WS / ranged focus:  
  - Commodore Tricorne +3  
  - Commodore Frac +3  
  - Commodore Gants +3  
  - Commodore Trews +3  
- **Weapon (Ranged)**: Upgrade to Fomalhaut or similar; if patient, Death Penalty (Mythic) or eventual Empy.  
- **Accessories / Set Bonuses**: Work up to augmented Camulus’s Mantle (store TP / ranged attack / snapshot variants) and improved rings.

### Content to Run  
- Dynamis‑D (for Relic +3 upgrades)  
- Additional Ambuscade/Omen for token farming  
- Join group runs for drop gear (AF pieces)  
- Sortie/High‑Tier content (if comfortable)

## 🚀 Advanced Stage (End‑game / +4 upgrades / Limbus / iL119+4)  
### Objectives  
- Incorporate the June 2025 update’s enhancements: Reforge AF/Relic +4 via Limbus units.  
- Exploit the updated Limbus (Temenos / Apollyon) for high‑tier gear, units, reforge currency.  
- Acquire BiS sets for COR: Ranged attack / snapshot / store TP / roll optimisation / WS niches.  
- Upgrade weapons to top‑tier (Death Penalty / Empyrean gun) and fully augment mantles.

### Gear Goals  
- **AF/Relic +4** (via Limbus‑units):  
  - Use “Units” earned in Limbus to reforge AF/Relic gear to +4 level.  
- **Camulus’s Mantle (Augmented)**:  
  - Multiple variants: TP/Ranged set, Leaden Salute (magic WS) set, Roll/Support set.  
- **Weapon (Ranged)**: Final upgrade path:  
  - Death Penalty (Mythic) or equivalent top gun  
  - If not Mythic, Fomalhaut + high augment sets are viable.  
- **WS Sets**:  
  - Leaden Salute (magic ranged WS) – focus on MAB/Magic Damage+ variants.  
  - Last Stand / Melee gun WS – ensure STR/AGI/R.Attk optimized.  
- **Roll/Utility Set**: Focus on CHR, Fast Cast, duration/roll bonuses.  
- **Defensive Sets** (Idle/PDT/MDT): While COR is DPS/support, don’t neglect survivability.

### Content to Run  
- Limbus (Temenos & Apollyon) – for units and high‑tier gear upgrades.  
- Endgame raids, Dynamis‑Divergence, Master Trials (depending on job role).  
- Sortie, Omen, high‑tier Ambuscade for rare materials/accessories.  
- Community group runs for weapons and accessories.
